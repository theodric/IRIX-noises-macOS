<H2>What are these IRIX desktop sounds?</H2>

<P>This is the soundscheme I put together for the Indigo Magic Desktop
in IRIX 5.3 (and it has survived largely intact through IRIX 6.5).
These sounds play when you use the mouse pointer to do operations on
icons such as moving an icon, dropping an icon on the dumpster, and
double-clicking to start an application.</P>

<P>I worked with Roger Powell (former member of the band Utopia) and
contractor Jeff Essex to specify a desired soundscheme. Using our
descriptions, Jeff created a pool of about 60 individual sounds.  Then
I selected from that set the sounds shown below, thereby creating a
soundscheme.  The scheme follows a generally percussive motif,
including toms, triangle, cymbal, and woodblock samples and
synthesized sounds.  Using <CODE>soundeditor</CODE> I truncated and
adjusted the amplitudes so the sounds are perceived to have about the
same loudness.</P>

<P>You may notice that the number of sounds in the scheme increased
from 12 sounds in IRIX 5.2, to 19 sounds in IRIX 5.3.  That's because
in addition to replacing existing sound files, I added code to the
desktop libraries to play sounds that did not exist before, such as
Remove, RemoveToDumpster, PutAway (obsolete in IRIX 6.3 and 6.4), and
OpenFolder.</P>

<P>The smaller files are in AIFC format; the rest are in AIFF.  Most
sounds play for less than one second.  The DeskSwitch and DropIgnore
sounds were never actually implemented in the desktop.</P>

<H2>How can I use these sounds in my own Web page?</H2>

<P>I like these sounds, and I like it when other people do too, but I
don't want anyone to get into copyright trouble. So please be sure to
cite this page if you want to use these sounds on your Web page or
elsewhere.</P>

<P>For a Web page, I suggest adding a footnote like this:
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-2">
<A 
HREF="http://ftp.sgi.com/sgi/desktop/sounds/sounds.html">
IRIX desktop sounds</A> courtesy the SGI desktop.</FONT></P>

<P>(Do View Document Source to get the HTML for this footnote.)</P>

<P>If you're using these sounds on your personal computer, I think
that's cool.  That is, I don't think SGI lawyers will come after you,
but I'd be jazzed if you let your friends know where you got the
sounds when they compliment you (grin).</P>

<A NAME="change">
<H2>How can I change the sounds on my IRIX workstation?</H2>

<P>As of IRIX 6.5, you <B>don't need root access</B> to modify sounds
on your SGI workstation, and users can modify sounds just for their
own account instead of the whole system.  Here's how to do it (from
the IRIX 6.5 <CODE>desktop_eoe</CODE> release notes, Appendix A):

<UL>
<LI>In the home directory, create a new directory to hold custom
sounds.  Rename it as <CODE>sound</CODE> if desired.</P>

<LI>Place new soundfiles into the sound directory.  They need to be in
AIFF-C format, recorded at 44.1kHz sampling rate, about 0.3 seconds in
duration, and neither too loud nor too soft.  See the
<CODE>soundeditor</CODE> man page for help editing soundfiles.</P>

<LI>Open the <CODE>/usr/share/data/sounds/soundscheme/schemes</CODE>
directory.  Copy the <CODE>defaultScheme.ss</CODE> file to the user's
sound directory.  Rename the copy to <CODE>my.ss</CODE> if desired.</P>

<LI>Edit the <CODE>my.ss</CODE> file.  Refer to the
<CODE>!</CODE>-denoted descriptions to decide which sounds to change.
To change a sound, replace the soundfile value with the name of a new
soundfile of the user's choice.  If changing only a few sounds, delete
the rest of the file and delete the corresponding sound labels from
the <CODE>*soundPalette</CODE> list at the top of the file.</P>

<P>Here is an example <CODE>my.ss</CODE> file that modifies just the
Warning sound, which plays when any new file is created on the desktop
or in a dirview:</P>

<PRE>
 *soundPalette: Warning

 *Warning.soundfile: /usr/people/me/sound/jazz_trumpet.aifc

 *Warning.label:     Warning
</PRE>

<LI>In a Unix shell, kill SoundScheme with the <CODE>killall
soundscheme</CODE> command.  Restart SoundScheme with the
<CODE>soundscheme -aux $HOME/sound/my.ss &</CODE> command.  This will
cause SoundScheme to read the <CODE>defaultScheme.ss</CODE> file then
load <CODE>my.ss</CODE>.</P>
</UL>

<P>After the above procedure, the IRIX Interactive Desktop should use
a combination of system default sounds (for any sounds not defined in
<CODE>my.ss</CODE>) and the user's new sounds.  If the user's new
sounds do not play, then the user should inspect <CODE>my.ss</CODE>
for typos and verify that the new soundfile is in AIFF-C format
sampled at 44.1kHz.</P>

<P>The new sounds will remain in effect only until the user logs out.
To keep the sounds across logins, the user needs to create or edit a
<CODE>$HOME/.xsession</CODE> file as follows:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Open the <CODE>/var/X11/xdm</CODE> directory and copy the
<CODE>Xsession.dt</CODE> file to the user's home directory, if one
does not already exist.  The copy must be renamed to
<CODE>.xsession</CODE> before proceeding.</P>

<LI>Edit the <CODE>.xsession</CODE> file.  Search for the section
that's marked "BEGIN SOUNDSCHEME MODIFICATIONS."  Change the line
<PRE>
  /usr/sbin/soundscheme >/dev/console 2>&1 &
</PRE>
to the following:
<PRE>
  /usr/sbin/soundscheme -aux $HOME/sound/my.ss >/dev/console 2>&1 &
</PRE>
Save the file, then log out and log back in.
</UL>

<P>With the <CODE>.xsession</CODE> modifications, the user's custom
sounds will be restored each time the user logs in.  If the user's new
sounds do not play, then there may be a typo in the
<CODE>.xsession</CODE> file that the user should fix.</P>

<P><B>Caution:</B> Changes to the <CODE>.xsession</CODE> file should be made
with care, as errors can prevent the user from logging in at the
console.  When the user logs in, <CODE>.xsession</CODE> will run
instead of the system default <CODE>/var/X11/xdm/Xsession.dt</CODE>
script.  It's up to users to remember that they have a
<CODE>.xsession</CODE> file.</P>

<!-- old way, pre-6.5
<P>The default sound scheme is a plain text file called 
<CODE>defaultScheme.ss</CODE> that lives in the 
<CODE>/usr/share/data/sounds/soundscheme/schemes</CODE> directory.
The sound files referenced in that scheme file are in
the <CODE>/usr/share/data/sounds/soundscheme/soundfiles</CODE> directory.
Modifying the settings in the scheme file will change the desktop
sounds for all users on the machine.</P>

<P>To change a sound in the default scheme you need
to do the following:
<UL>
<LI> Become root, then change your directory
to <CODE>/usr/share/data/sounds/soundscheme/schemes</CODE>.</P>
<LI> Copy <CODE>defaultScheme.ss</CODE> to <CODE>defaultScheme.ss.bak</CODE> as a
backup, in case you want to revert to the original scheme in the
future.</P>
<LI> Place your new sound file into the
aforementioned <CODE>soundfiles</CODE> directory.</P>
<LI> Edit the <CODE>defaultScheme.ss</CODE> file, and
change the appropriate <CODE>.soundfile</CODE> name to be the filename
of your new sound file.</P>
<LI> Kill and restart SoundScheme with the <CODE>killall soundscheme</CODE>
and <CODE>soundscheme</CODE> commands, respectively, or by logging
out and logging back in.
</UL>

<P>Future IRIX releases may overwrite the scheme
and sound files in these directories.
</P>
-->

<P><B>Tips:</B> To avoid having to wait for sounds to play out when
you use the desktop, keep your sounds short (a fraction of a second).
To avoid giving yourself a heart attack when you use the desktop, use
<CODE>soundeditor</CODE> to adjust the sound levels relative to each
other so they all seem about the same loudness, and (if needed) fade
the volume in at the beginning and out at the end of each sound to
avoid abrupt pops or transitions.
</P>

<P>If you come up with an exciting new soundscheme, I'd love to hear
it! Please <A HREF="mailto:rcu@engr.sgi.com?RCU's online sounds
page">email me</A> if you are willing to share.  I will not use your
sounds in the IRIX desktop unless you give permission, of course.  If
it's a really cool scheme that you'd like us to use, the desktop group
may be able to arrange some kind of compensation.  Thank you for your
interest!</P>
